<h1 style="font-size:300%;">Proprietary languages</h1>

<h1 style="font-size:150%;">Although most of the most commonly used programming languages have fully open 
specifications and implementations, many programming languages exist only as proprietary programming languages
 with the implementation available only from a single vendor,
 which may claim that such a proprietary language is their intellectual property. 
 Proprietary programming languages are commonly domain specific languages or internal scripting 
 languages for a single product; some proprietary languages are used only internally within a vendor,
 while others are available to external users.

Some programming languages exist on the border between proprietary and open; for example,
 Oracle Corporation asserts proprietary rights to some aspects of the Java programming language,
  and Microsoft's C# programming language, which has open implementations of most parts of the system,
 also has Common Language Runtime (CLR) as a closed environment.

Many proprietary languages are widely used, in spite of their proprietary nature;
 examples include MATLAB, VBScript, and Wolfram Language. Some languages may make the transition from closed to open;

 for example, Erlang was originally an Ericsson's internal programming language.</h1>
